# Compendium Scribe

[![Build Status](https://github.com/btfranklin/compendiumscribe/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/btfranklin/compendiumscribe/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)
[![Supports Python versions 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/compendiumscribe.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/compendiumscribe)

Compendium Scribe is a Click-driven command line tool and library that uses OpenAI's **deep research** models to assemble a highly structured XML compendium for any topic. The workflow combines optional prompt refinement (powered by `gpt-4.1`), an `o3-deep-research` call with web search tooling, and deterministic post-processing to turn the model output into a dependable knowledge asset.

---

## Features
- üîç **Deep research pipeline** ‚Äî orchestrates prompt planning, background execution, and tool-call capture with `o3-deep-research`.
- üß± **Rich data model** ‚Äî includes sections, insights, citations, and research trace metadata for auditing.
- üßæ **Structured XML output** ‚Äî produces a schema-friendly document ready for downstream conversion (HTML, Markdown, PDF pipelines, etc.).
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable CLI** ‚Äî control background execution, tool call limits, and output paths.
- üß™ **Testable architecture** ‚Äî research orchestration is decoupled from the OpenAI client, making it simple to stub in tests.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pdm install --dev
```

Ensure `PDM_HOME` points to a writable location when developing within a sandboxed environment.

### 2. Configure credentials

Create a `.env` file (untracked) with your OpenAI credentials:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Deep research requires an OpenAI account with the browsing tooling enabled. Document any environment keys for additional tooling in the repo as you add them.

### 3. Generate a compendium

```bash
pdm run create-compendium "Lithium-ion battery recycling"
```

Options:
- `--output PATH` ‚Äî where to write the XML file (defaults to `<slug>_<timestamp>.xml`).
- `--no-background` ‚Äî force synchronous execution (useful for short or restricted queries).
- `--max-tool-calls N` ‚Äî cap the total number of tool calls for cost control.
- `--export-format FORMAT` ‚Äî repeat to emit Markdown (`md`), HTML (`html`), or PDF (`pdf`) alongside the base XML output.

Example output file name: `lithium-ion-battery-recycling_20250107_143233.xml`.

## Library Usage

```python
from compendiumscribe import build_compendium, ResearchConfig, DeepResearchError

try:
    compendium = build_compendium(
        "Emerging pathogen surveillance",
        config=ResearchConfig(background=False, max_tool_calls=30),
    )
except DeepResearchError as exc:
    # Handle or log deep research failures
    raise

xml_payload = compendium.to_xml_string()

# Alternate exports
markdown_doc = compendium.to_markdown()
html_doc = compendium.to_html()
pdf_bytes = compendium.to_pdf_bytes()
```

The returned `Compendium` object contains structured sections, insights, citations, open questions, and the trace of tool calls used during research.

## Data Model Overview

Compendium Scribe produces XML shaped like:

```xml
<compendium topic="Lithium-ion Battery Recycling" generated_at="2025-01-07T14:32:33+00:00">
  <overview><![CDATA[Comprehensive synthesis of the state of lithium-ion recycling...]]></overview>
  <methodology>
    <step><![CDATA[Surveyed peer-reviewed literature from 2022‚Äì2025]]></step>
    <step><![CDATA[Corroborated industrial capacity data with regulatory filings]]></step>
  </methodology>
  <sections>
    <section id="S01">

  <research_trace>
    <trace_event id="ws_1" type="web_search_call" status="completed">
      <action>{"type": "search", "query": "lithium ion recycling throughput"}</action>
    </trace_event>
  </research_trace>
</compendium>
```

This format is intentionally verbose to support downstream transformation and provenance tracking.

## Testing & Quality

- `pdm run pytest` ‚Äî executes the unit suite. Tests stub the OpenAI client, so they run offline.
- `pdm run flake8 src tests` ‚Äî linting.
- `pdm build` ‚Äî produce distributable artifacts.

If `pdm` fails to write log files in restricted environments, set `PDM_HOME` to a writable directory (for example, `export PDM_HOME=.pdm_home`).

---
